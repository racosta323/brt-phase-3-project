# Travel CLI + ORM Application

## Overview

The Travel CLI + ORM application is a command-line interface tool with an integrated Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system designed to help users organize and compare travel information effortlessly. Users can input details about their trips and those of their friends, allowing for easy management and comparison of travel plans.

## Features

You now have a basic idea of what constitutes a CLI. Fork and clone this lesson
for a project template for your CLI.

Take a look at the directory structure:

```console
.
├── Pipfile
├── Pipfile.lock
├── README.md
└── lib
    |__ __init__.py
    ├── cli.py
    ├── debug.py
    └── helpers.py
```

Note: The directory also includes two files named `CONTRIBUTING.md` and
`LICENSE.md` that are specific to Flatiron's curriculum. You can disregard or
delete the files if you want.

## Updating README.md

`README.md` is a Markdown file that should describe your project. You will
replace the contents of this `README.md` file with a description of **your**
actual project.

Markdown is not a language that we cover in Flatiron's Software Engineering
curriculum, but it's not a particularly difficult language to learn (if you've
ever left a comment on Reddit, you might already know the basics). Refer to the
cheat sheet in this assignments's resources for a basic guide to Markdown.

### What Goes into a README?

This README serves as a template. Replace the contents of this file to describe
the important files in your project and describe what they do. Each Python file
that you edit should get at least a paragraph, and each function should be
described with a sentence or two.

Describe your actual CLI script first, and with a good level of detail. The rest
should be ordered by importance to the user. (Probably functions next, then
models.)

Screenshots and links to resources that you used throughout are also useful to
users and collaborators, but a little more syntactically complicated. Only add
these in if you're feeling comfortable with Markdown.
